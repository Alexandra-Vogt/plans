* MASTER TODO LIST:

  The goal of this document is to create a course for me to brush up on computer
  science and deal with the weaknesses I have when it comes to the Triplebyte
  exam, thereby ensuring that I pass and get a job.

  According to Triplebyte I am good at back-end web and systems architecture but
  am quite shit at low level systems and academic CS. I intend to remedy this by
  becoming good at those while also becoming much faster. (though apparently I
  was actually fast enough by their standards).

*** TODO [#A] Cease to be scrub
*** TODO [#A] Take Triplebyte test
